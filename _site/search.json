    "text": "This study explores the use of Google Trends as a proxy to measure public interest in distance education solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. It presents the first detailed, global-level analysis of web search behavior related to distance learning, combining both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. Unlike prior research that was either limited in scope or narrowly focused, this study examined a wide array of search terms to capture evolving global attention toward digital education tools.\nResults revealed a strong cross-correlation between search interest in COVID-19 and distance education-related terms, indicating that public concern about the pandemic significantly influenced online engagement with learning technologies. A comprehensive Google Trends footprint analysis highlighted surges in popularity for specific e-learning platforms, suggesting shifts in user preferences during crisis periods.\nImportantly, the study also uncovered psychological implications tied to these behavioral patterns. Spikes in search volumes often coincided with periods of heightened uncertainty and lockdowns—reflecting increased psychological stress and a parallel demand for structured learning environments and support tools. This insight underscores the dual need for educational and mental health support during prolonged disruptions like a pandemic.\nFrom a data science and anomaly detection perspective, these findings are particularly valuable. The sudden, sharp increases in search volume for certain distance learning tools represent clear anomalies in typical web search behavior. Such anomalies—triggered by an external shock like COVID-19—demonstrate how real-world events manifest in digital behavioral data. This aligns with current trends in anomaly detection research, where the goal is to detect anomalies in large collection of time series data. The methodology and results of this study offer a compelling case for integrating anomaly detection techniques into the monitoring of online educational tool adoption, especially for crisis-response planning."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This study proposes a novel and explainable framework for the early detection of anomalies in image streams, aimed at addressing critical challenges in fields such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and public safety. Unlike traditional supervised learning methods that rely heavily on large, labeled datasets and struggle to detect previously unseen anomalies, the proposed approach adopts a semi-supervised learning paradigm. It models only the typical behavior and detects anomalies as deviations from this learned norm using a combination of computer vision techniques, univariate time series forecasting, and a data-driven thresholding method grounded in Extreme Value Theory. To improve model transparency and interpretability, explainable AI techniques are integrated into the deep learning module, offering insights into the contribution of extracted features to anomaly detection decisions.\nThe framework’s effectiveness and generalizability were tested across multiple real-world scenarios. These included monitoring progressive deforestation through satellite imagery, detecting changes following an undersea volcanic eruption, and analyzing flood impact caused by torrential rainfall. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully identify anomalies in diverse contexts, even with limited labeled data. Furthermore, the study highlights that while deep learning models perform well with larger datasets, conventional machine learning approaches are more effective with smaller datasets. By combining anomaly detection with interpretability, the framework not only improves detection accuracy but also builds user trust and supports informed decision-making across different application domains."

The project is funded under OWSD Early Career Fellowship scheme awarded to Dr. Priyanga Dilini Talagala (2021-2025).\nWith the spread of the Internet of Things and as more and more devices are providing live streaming data, detecting anomalies in this data is becoming an increasingly important research topic. Anomaly detection has been explored within diverse research areas and application domains such as fraud detection, health monitoring, and environmental monitoring. Despite the ever-increasing attention and resources devoted to it, some challenges in anomaly detection are not supported by existing methods. RETINA project is in an attempt to reduce this gap by introducing novel anomaly detection frameworks for different data scenarios."
