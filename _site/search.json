    "text": "Detecting anomalies in tabular time-series data is challenging because each dataset can have different patterns and behaviors. A single model often struggles to perform well across different types of data. To address this, this study proposes a flexible ensemble-based framework that combines the strengths of several models to improve anomaly detection.\nOur approach uses meta-learning to guide the selection of the best combination of models for a given dataset. We extract meta-features—summaries of the dataset’s structure and characteristics—to help the system decide which models to use and how much to rely on each one.\nThe model pool includes a variety of techniques from machine learning, deep learning, and generative models. For example, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are included with hybrid designs to better capture both high-dimensional features and time-based patterns.\nTo combine the outputs of the different models, we use a method called stacking, which learns how to weight the predictions based on past performance. This allows the framework to adapt better than traditional averaging or voting methods.\nOverall, this project aims to build a robust and adaptable system for detecting anomalies in time-series data across many domains, helping to improve accuracy and reduce the need for manual tuning."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This study proposes a novel and explainable framework for the early detection of anomalies in image streams, aimed at addressing critical challenges in fields such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and public safety. Unlike traditional supervised learning methods that rely heavily on large, labeled datasets and struggle to detect previously unseen anomalies, the proposed approach adopts a semi-supervised learning paradigm. It models only the typical behavior and detects anomalies as deviations from this learned norm using a combination of computer vision techniques, univariate time series forecasting, and a data-driven thresholding method grounded in Extreme Value Theory. To improve model transparency and interpretability, explainable AI techniques are integrated into the deep learning module, offering insights into the contribution of extracted features to anomaly detection decisions.\nThe framework’s effectiveness and generalizability were tested across multiple real-world scenarios. These included monitoring progressive deforestation through satellite imagery, detecting changes following an undersea volcanic eruption, and analyzing flood impact caused by torrential rainfall. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully identify anomalies in diverse contexts, even with limited labeled data. Furthermore, the study highlights that while deep learning models perform well with larger datasets, conventional machine learning approaches are more effective with smaller datasets. By combining anomaly detection with interpretability, the framework not only improves detection accuracy but also builds user trust and supports informed decision-making across different application domains."

The project is funded under OWSD Early Career Fellowship scheme awarded to Dr. Priyanga Dilini Talagala (2021-2025).\nWith the spread of the Internet of Things and as more and more devices are providing live streaming data, detecting anomalies in this data is becoming an increasingly important research topic. Anomaly detection has been explored within diverse research areas and application domains such as fraud detection, health monitoring, and environmental monitoring. Despite the ever-increasing attention and resources devoted to it, some challenges in anomaly detection are not supported by existing methods. RETINA project is in an attempt to reduce this gap by introducing novel anomaly detection frameworks for different data scenarios."

The overall aim of this project is therefore to tackle the key mathematical challenges in the early detection of anomalies in different data scenarios."
