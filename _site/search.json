    "text": "The issue of class overlap in classification arises when two or more classes share similar feature representations, making it challenging for a classification model to differentiate between them with accuracy. This problem can lead to misclassification errors, which can significantly impact the performance of classification models and make it difficult to interpret the decision-making process. In this session, I will discuss our novel XAI framework that provides post-hoc, model-agnostic, and local explanations to enhance the trustworthiness of classification models in the presence of overlapping problems. Our framework derives a feature map using different transfer learning approaches, reduces feature space dimensionality, detects overlapping regions using density estimation, and integrates an XAI module to explain the classification model. We assess the framework’s validity using real-world datasets and demonstrate its usefulness in enhancing model transparency and interpretability in the presence of class overlapping problems. Furthermore, we introduce the R package “clap” to facilitate the detection of overlapping regions in multidimensional data, as proposed in our approach.\nThe development version of this project can be explored on GitHub."

    "section": "",
    "text": "With the proliferation of social media, the public has increasingly turned to use images to communicate and share information. However, this trend has also led to an increase in the number of ways that images can be duplicated, either maliciously or innocently. The detection of duplicate images has a wide range of applications, including addressing issues of copyright infringement, combating misinformation, and addressing ethical concerns. Through this study, we aim to propose an efficient and accurate duplicate image detection framework that can be applied to various image databases with varying data challenges. The proposed solution is a comprehensive coarse-to-fine module where the coarse module focuses on limiting the image dataset by selecting candidate images and the fine-module focuses on deep diving into local similarity. A Feature Contribution Explainability submodule provides visualizations of the areas contributing to the duplicate detection of the images. Through the integration of these modules, the proposed system aims to achieve efficient and effective filtering of large image databases. By combining high-level and low-level feature extraction, contextual information embedding, and attention mechanisms, the system offers a comprehensive approach to candidate image identification and ranking images according to the similarity. Experimental results demonstrate the system’s potential in accurately selecting candidate images with high probability for duplicate detection and provide insights into the contributed areas within the images."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This study proposes a novel and explainable framework for the early detection of anomalies in image streams, aimed at addressing critical challenges in fields such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and public safety. Unlike traditional supervised learning methods that rely heavily on large, labeled datasets and struggle to detect previously unseen anomalies, the proposed approach adopts a semi-supervised learning paradigm. It models only the typical behavior and detects anomalies as deviations from this learned norm using a combination of computer vision techniques, univariate time series forecasting, and a data-driven thresholding method grounded in Extreme Value Theory. To improve model transparency and interpretability, explainable AI techniques are integrated into the deep learning module, offering insights into the contribution of extracted features to anomaly detection decisions.\nThe framework’s effectiveness and generalizability were tested across multiple real-world scenarios. These included monitoring progressive deforestation through satellite imagery, detecting changes following an undersea volcanic eruption, and analyzing flood impact caused by torrential rainfall. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully identify anomalies in diverse contexts, even with limited labeled data. Furthermore, the study highlights that while deep learning models perform well with larger datasets, conventional machine learning approaches are more effective with smaller datasets. By combining anomaly detection with interpretability, the framework not only improves detection accuracy but also builds user trust and supports informed decision-making across different application domains."

The project is funded under OWSD Early Career Fellowship scheme awarded to Dr. Priyanga Dilini Talagala (2021-2025).\nWith the spread of the Internet of Things and as more and more devices are providing live streaming data, detecting anomalies in this data is becoming an increasingly important research topic. Anomaly detection has been explored within diverse research areas and application domains such as fraud detection, health monitoring, and environmental monitoring. Despite the ever-increasing attention and resources devoted to it, some challenges in anomaly detection are not supported by existing methods. RETINA project is in an attempt to reduce this gap by introducing novel anomaly detection frameworks for different data scenarios."

The overall aim of this project is therefore to tackle the key mathematical challenges in the early detection of anomalies in different data scenarios."

    "text": "When the pandemic brought global travel to a standstill, academic life transformed almost overnight. Borders closed, flights were canceled, and conference halls fell silent. Yet research did not stop; it adapted. In 2021, I had the opportunity to present my work at the OWSD 6th General Assembly and International Conference, which was centered on the theme “Women, Science and Development.” The conference explored three critical areas: the importance of basic sciences for development, the impact of applied sciences on development, and the inclusion of sex and gender as variables in scientific research. Although I could not attend in person, I shared my research through a virtual poster presentation, illustrating how knowledge continues to travel and inspire, even when physical movement is restricted.\nOur poster, “Attention Towards Distance Education Tools During COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Google Trends,” was co-authored with Dr. Thiyanga S. Talagala. The study explored how global interest in digital learning platforms surged when schools closed and education had to shift rapidly online. For researchers, educators, and policymakers grappling with these challenges in real time, this work offered timely insight into how learners adapted and what tools they turned to during crisis-driven remote teaching.\n\n\n\nUnlike a traditional poster pinned to a board in a crowded hall, this conference required us to rethink communication. We were invited not just to upload a poster, but also to record a five-minute video, summarizing methods, insights, and policy relevance. It was a new kind of challenge, compressing meaningful analysis into a concise format that anyone could return to at any moment during the conference.\nEvery poster presenter was also asked to reflect on how their work aligned with development goals, especially the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For us, the inroads were clear,SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).\n\n\n\nThe live poster session on November 9, 2021, took place in GatherTown, a virtual environment designed like a conference lounge. Each presenter had a virtual booth labeled with their surname. I walked my avatar through the poster hall, found my booth, and waited, just as I would in person.\nThe moment someone’s avatar walked near mine, a video chat opened. Suddenly, we were live, presenting, answering questions, exchanging ideas. Researchers from different continents engaged with the work: asking whether digital divides shaped the trends, whether rising search interest translated into actual access, and how the findings could guide future education policy after COVID-19.\nThe poster session featured four important discussion themes: “Applied sciences: impact on development”, “Including sex-gender as variables in scientific research”, “OWSD members response to COVID-19 pandemic”, and “The importance of basic sciences for development”. All posters are available for viewing here.\nAll posters in my session on “OWSD Members’ Response to COVID-19 Pandemic” can be viewed here.\nMy recorded poster presentation is available here.\nThis experience marked a shift in how I thought about academic engagement. It was proof that knowledge-sharing does not stop when the world shuts down. Instead, it adapts. The medium changes, but the purpose remains: to learn, to question, to contribute."

This framework is capable of adapting to different diseases and regions, enabling more accurate outbreak detection across different datasets.

The selected case for the focal study represents food products with a common main ingredient used in manufacturing.  We employ two scenarios: 1) forecasting aggregated total sales for all products, and 2) forecasting sales for each product separately to calculate the total requirement. We employed three statistical models: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing (ETS), and Prophet, and five machine learning models such as linear regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The key findings highlight that forecasting aggregated total sales for common ingredients outperformed forecasting for each product individually. Further, island-level forecasts were more accurate than district- and distribution-center-level forecasts. XGBoost performed as the best forecasting model, and MinT outperformed as the best reconciliation approach.

This study contributes to supply chain strategies when products have common ingredients, optimizing resource allocation and production planning, enhancing operational efficiency in food manufacturing.\nKeywords: Demand Forecasting, Food Manufacturing, Hierarchical Forecasting, Machine Learning, Time Series, ARIMA, ETS, Prophet, XGBoost, MinT\n🔗 View on IEEE Xplore \n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Gayathri Sivakumar, Chambavy Balasundaram, Vithursan Thevendran, Priyanga Dilini Talagala\nPublished in: 2024 9th International Conference on Information Technology Research (ICITR), Colombo, Sri Lanka, 05-06 December 2024\nDOI: 10.1109/ICITR64794.2024.10857748\nAbstract:\n\n\nThis study presents a hybrid approach that combines deep learning techniques with conventional machine learning techniques to address the class imbalance in the classification of multi-dimensional data.  The resulting framework incorporates SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to evaluate the model predictions based on domain knowledge. It combines Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs), Self-Supervised Clustered GANs (SSCGANs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of improved synthetic data. This method ensures that model decisions are based on domain-specific knowledge while enabling efficient computation of SHAP values by approximation of complex classifiers using surrogate models. Evaluations show that the suggested method overcomes the shortcomings of current techniques in high-stakes domains and improves classification performance and transparency.\nKeywords: Class Imbalance, Multi-Dimensional Data, SHAP, CGAN, SSCGAN, VAE, Explainable AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning\n🔗 View on IEEE Xplore \n\n\nRead More"

This insight underscores the dual need for educational and mental health support during prolonged disruptions like a pandemic.\nFrom a data science and anomaly detection perspective, these findings are particularly valuable. The sudden, sharp increases in search volume for certain distance learning tools represent clear anomalies in typical web search behavior. Such anomalies—triggered by an external shock like COVID-19—demonstrate how real-world events manifest in digital behavioral data.

    "text": "Floods represent one of the most significant natural hazards in Sri Lanka, with recurring monsoon induced events causing substantial loss of life and economic damage. Existing flood prediction systems face critical limitations including irregular data formats, static warning thresholds, and inadequate spatial integration, resulting in insufficient lead times and reduced prediction accuracy. This research addresses these challenges through the development of a comprehensive AI-driven flood prediction and early warning system specifically designed for Sri Lankan River basins.\nThe study presents a multi-module framework that integrates advanced machine learning techniques with automated data management and spatial analysis. The approach combines geographical location-specific modeling using enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks with spatio-temporal analysis that leverages upstream-downstream relationships within river networks. A novel automated database creation system employs Natural Language Processing and image processing techniques to standardize heterogeneous data sources from Disaster Management Center reports. Dynamic flood alert threshold calculation replaces static warning systems with adaptive, data-driven approaches that account for seasonal variations and antecedent conditions.\nThe framework further incorporates comprehensive geospatial analysis for flood hazard zoning through integration of satellite imagery and meteorological data, enhanced with explainable artificial intelligence for transparent decision-making. A temporal analysis component provides location-specific NDWI-based flood risk assessment enabling proactive management strategies.\nValidation demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over traditional baseline methods, with successful integration of multi-station data enhancing downstream flood predictions. The automated data processing pipeline effectively transforms unstructured reports into analysis-ready datasets, while dynamic thresholding significantly outperforms static alert systems in early warning capability. The integrated system successfully addresses the unique challenges of tropical monsoon environments while providing extended lead times essential for effective disaster response.\nThis research establishes a novel paradigm for AI-driven flood prediction in data-scarce regions, contributing significant advances to hydrological modeling, automated environmental data processing, and operational early warning systems. The comprehensive approach offers broad applicability to similar monsoon-affected regions worldwide while providing immediate operational benefits for Sri Lankan flood management authorities\n\n\n\n\nProposed framework"
