    "text": "This study proposes a novel and explainable framework for the early detection of anomalies in image streams, aimed at addressing critical challenges in fields such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and public safety. Unlike traditional supervised learning methods that rely heavily on large, labeled datasets and struggle to detect previously unseen anomalies, the proposed approach adopts a semi-supervised learning paradigm. It models only the typical behavior and detects anomalies as deviations from this learned norm using a combination of computer vision techniques, univariate time series forecasting, and a data-driven thresholding method grounded in Extreme Value Theory. To improve model transparency and interpretability, explainable AI techniques are integrated into the deep learning module, offering insights into the contribution of extracted features to anomaly detection decisions.\nThe framework’s effectiveness and generalizability were tested across multiple real-world scenarios. These included monitoring progressive deforestation through satellite imagery, detecting changes following an undersea volcanic eruption, and analyzing flood impact caused by torrential rainfall. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully identify anomalies in diverse contexts, even with limited labeled data. Furthermore, the study highlights that while deep learning models perform well with larger datasets, conventional machine learning approaches are more effective with smaller datasets. By combining anomaly detection with interpretability, the framework not only improves detection accuracy but also builds user trust and supports informed decision-making across different application domains."

    "text": "RETINA: (REvolutionising monitoring systems and Techniques in the INformation Age”) is a research and innovation project funded by the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD), a program unit of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The project is funded under OWSD Early Career Fellowship scheme awarded to Dr. Priyanga Dilini Talagala (2021-2025).\nWith the spread of the Internet of Things and as more and more devices are providing live streaming data, detecting anomalies in this data is becoming an increasingly important research topic. Anomaly detection has been explored within diverse research areas and application domains such as fraud detection, health monitoring, and environmental monitoring. Despite the ever-increasing attention and resources devoted to it, some challenges in anomaly detection are not supported by existing methods. RETINA project is in an attempt to reduce this gap by introducing novel anomaly detection frameworks for different data scenarios."

The overall aim of this project is therefore to tackle the key mathematical challenges in the early detection of anomalies in different data scenarios."

The RETINA logo is a symbolic representation of these key focuses of the RETINA project.\n\nThe retina is a layer of nerve cells located on the back inside wall of our eyeball which helps us to convert light into signals that our brain can interpret. Several parts of the eye are associated with the retina. Under RETINA project, we do collaborative research to pursue key mathematical challenges in anomaly detection. The RETINA project logo represents the retina inside an eye.\nThe central part of the logo contains Florence Nightingale’s “Rose” diagram. Data Visualization is one of the major pillars of Data Science and Florence Nightingale is a pioneer in the visual presentation of information and statistical graphics. She is a statistician and the founder of modern nursing and Rose plot is one of her unique contributions to data visualization. The RETINA logo recognizes the achievements and contributions of all the women in STEM fields.\n\n\n\n\nFlorence Nightingale. Diagram of the Causes of Mortality in the Army of the East, 1858.
