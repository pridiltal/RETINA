## Project Overview

Detecting anomalies in tabular time-series data is challenging because each dataset can have different patterns and behaviors. **A single model often struggles to perform well across different types of data**. To address this, this study proposes a flexible ensemble-based framework that combines the strengths of several models to improve anomaly detection.

Our approach uses meta-learning to guide the selection of the best combination of models for a given dataset. We extract meta-features—summaries of the dataset’s structure and characteristics—to help the system decide which models to use and how much to rely on each one.

The model pool includes a variety of techniques from machine learning, deep learning, and generative models. For example, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are included with hybrid designs to better capture both high-dimensional features and time-based patterns.

To combine the outputs of the different models, we use a method called stacking, which learns how to weight the predictions based on past performance. This allows the framework to adapt better than traditional averaging or voting methods.

Overall, this project aims to build a robust and adaptable system for detecting anomalies in time-series data across many domains, helping to improve accuracy and reduce the need for manual tuning.
